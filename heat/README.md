# Orchestration Heat

> Return to [Homepage](../README.md "Homepage")

## What is Heat ?
Heat is the main project in the OpenStack Orchestration program. It implements an orchestration engine to launch multiple composite cloud applications based on templates in the form of text files that can be treated like code. A native Heat template format is evolving, but Heat also endeavours to provide compatibility with the AWS CloudFormation template format, so that many existing CloudFormation templates can be launched on OpenStack. Heat provides both an OpenStack-native REST API and a CloudFormation-compatible Query API.
