# OCTANE cIAP

## Presentation

---

There are several layers (from the most exposed to the less exposed):

* resilient load-balancers
* resilient firewalls
* resilient WAF or TCP relay (it depends on the protocole used)
* resilient firewalls
* AWS private link or VPC peering (what suits you)

Several functionnalities are implemented :

* automated SSL certificates creation
* automated haproxy configuration (if choosen)
* automated httpd and/or nginx configuration
  * modsecurity module
  * vhosts whith the availability to enable or not modsecurity
  * udp configuration with Nginx
* automated iptables configuration

There are five roles:

* common : common tasks
* lb : shunt streams based on rules
* waf : performs security tasks for HTTP/HTTPS streams
* vpn : grant customers access to theirs VPC
* fw : filter access to customers VPC
* met : statistics about this VPC

# Usage
---

A CLI is provided. This CLI is one script, linked to itself by each tag.

For exemple, if you link the base script to init, then if you use:
```bash
./init -s <stack>
```
then the CLI will launch all ansible tasks with tag "init".

Eleven usages are available :

* init: initialise an OCTANE stack
* common: common role 
* up_lb: load-balancer role on exposed zone
* mid_waf: WAF role on filtered zone
* mid_vpn: VPN role on filtered zone
* low_fw: FW role on private zone
* low_met: Metering role on private zone
* revokedomain: remove an existing domain from an OCTANE stack
* grantdomain: add a new domain to an OCTANE stack
* grantvpnclient: add a new VPN client to an existing domain
* revokevpnclient: remove an existing VPN client from an existing domain

# Dependencies

---

Does not depend on any other roles, but the host need to have:

* the function tag
* the stage tag
* the cloudformation stack name.

An `ansible.cfg` is present on the current directory with :

```ini

[defaults]
retry_files_enabled = false
inventory = ansible-inventory.py
remote_user = root
stdout_callback = debug
host_key_checking = false

```
