* waf : performs security tasks for HTTP/HTTPS streams
* vpn : grant customers access to theirs instances
* fw : filter access to customers instances
* met : statistics about this instances

## Usage

---

A CLI is provided. This CLI is one script, linked to itself by each tag.

For exemple, if you link the base script to init, then if you use:
```bash
./init -s <stack>
```
then the CLI will launch all ansible tasks with tag "init".

Eleven usages are available :

* init: initialise an OCTANE stack
* common: common role
* up_lb: load-balancer role on exposed zone
* mid_waf: WAF role on filtered zone
* mid_vpn: VPN role on filtered zone
* low_fw: FW role on private zone
* low_met: Metering role on private zone
* revokedomain: remove an existing domain from an OCTANE stack
* grantdomain: add a new domain to an OCTANE stack
* grantvpnclient: add a new VPN client to an existing domain
* revokevpnclient: remove an existing VPN client from an existing domain

## Main Playbook used

---

```yaml
---
- name: Apply common configuration to "{{ stack }}"
  hosts: "{{ stack }}"
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - common

- name: cIAP "{{ stack }}" setup for "up_lb"
  hosts: "{{ stack }}:&up:&lb"
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - "up_lb"

- name: cIAP "{{ stack }}" setup for "mid_waf"
  hosts: "{{ stack }}:&mid:&waf"
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - "mid_waf"

- name: cIAP "{{ stack }}" setup for "mid_vpn"
  hosts: "{{ stack }}:&mid:&vpn"
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - "mid_vpn"

- name: cIAP "{{ stack }}" setup for "low_fw"
  hosts: "{{ stack }}:&low:&fw"
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - "low_fw"

- name: cIAP "{{ stack }}" setup for "low_met"
  hosts: "{{ stack }}:&low:&met"
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - "low_met"

- name: cIAP "{{ stack }}" checks
  hosts: "{{ stack }}:&check"
  run_once: true
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - "check"
```

## Dependencies

---

Does not depend on any other roles, but the host need to have:

* the function tag
* the stage tag
* the heat stack name.

An `ansible.cfg` is present on the current directory with :
```ini
[defaults]
retry_files_enabled = false
inventory = openstack-inventory.py
stdout_callback = debug
host_key_checking = false
stdout_callback = json
```
