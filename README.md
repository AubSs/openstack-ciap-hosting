# Openstack cIAP OCTANE

## What's OCTANE ?

**OCTANE** is:

* A cIAP (**C**loud **I**nternet **A**ccess **P**oint). Mainly, it is a **security product** between Internet and your public application hosted in your private zone
* The acronym (with imagination and goodwill) of **Opensource cIAP Nextgen**
* A [Societe Generale](https://www.societegenerale.com) Open Source project developped within **Public Cloud**
* Feature Team (Cloud Center Of Excellence) by:
    * [Aubin LAGORCE](https://github.com/AubSs) for Openstack
    * [Eric BOUTEVILLE](https://github.com/qrn77) for [AWS](https://github.com/societe-generale/OCTANE)
* Is currently available for [AWS](https://github.com/societe-generale/OCTANE) & Openstack

**OCTANE** can:

* **Securly expose** a WebSite to Internet
* Protect you against **intrusions** (SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion...) & **virus**
* Limit you against **deny of service**
* Detect **malicious activities** or **policy violations**
* Securly **connect your external users** to your internal zone
* Collect **all the logs** and provide **metrics, search and analytics**
* Be **easly derivated on other x86** (GCP, Bare-Metal, etc.) platform in order to have **the same Internet Access Point in a multi-cloud context**


## How OCTANE is designed ?

[![ARCHITECTURE](docs/architecture.png)]()

There are several layers (from the most exposed -Internet- to the less exposed -Internal-)Â :

* Redundant load-balancers
* Redundant filtering layer
* Redundant reverse-proxies
* Redundant proxies with SSL terminaison
* Redundant WAF or TCP relay (it depends on the protocol used)
* Redundant Antivirus & IDS
* Redundant VPN
* Redundant firewalls

Those functionnalities are deployed by:
* The **Openstack orchestration heat template** aims to build the Openstack infrastructure
* The **Ansible playbook** will configure all software components

For further details, a more complete READme is available in each directory.
